Hi, my name is Lionel. I'm currently studying computer science at the University of Bern. 

I like coding in my free time (though most often the silly kind, like [simulating digital circuits in the form of ASCII-art (ASCIIrcuit)](https://github.com/lionelsemion/asciircuit)). Everything I create is under the [GNU General Public License](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License), so you are free to use my code for everything you want, as long as you credit me and use the same license (or a compatible one) for your project. Also [being open is really cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJzV0CX0q8o).

Stuff I've coded up in the last many years include:
- A program that draws all the RGB colors on a single image (looks really cool)
- A genetic algorithm that evolves a canvas into a given image by drawing random lines onto it (sounds more complicated than it really is)
- [A neural network that can guess which party a given Swiss politician is a member of (surprisingly accurate)](https://github.com/lionelsemion/party-prediction)
- A mess of a Python script that can accurately calculate your heart and respiration rate in sleep by doing some cursed numpy stuff to gyroscope data, gathered by the phone you are supposed to tape onto your chest (my Maturaarbeit (final project in highschool (in Switzerland)))
- And lots more (I have only just started to sort through all the things I've created (but never made open (because most of it is really messy)))

(Links will be added once I've uploaded the projects)

I have to admit, that I stuck to coding in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) for a way too long time (like until age 14 or something), so here are some noteworthy things I did back then.

Kinda cool stuff I did in Scratch:
- [My very own programming language](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/388173218/) (very cursed (you could almost call it funktional))
- [A co****virus simulation](https://forkphorus.github.io/app.html?id=380608070) (it is made in Scratch, you can find the source code [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/380608070/) (Forkphorus compiles Scratch project to JavaScript to make them run faster (or something like that)))
- [A simple sudoku solver](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/454800450/) (uses human "algorithms" (can thus only solve really simple sudokus))
- A binary data format that can represent a lot of diffenent stuff (Use [this](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/192259063/) encoder for different bitmap image formats and black-and-white animation and others and use [this](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/347800995/) encoder for vector graphics (to decode any of those formats use [this](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/169547883/) decoder (the format can also be used for (MIDI-like) music (though there is no encoder for this (and also no documentation)), if you really want to, you can try copy pasting the example binary codes in the description of the decoder)))

"Games" I did in Scratch:
- [A kinda-3D platformer](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/416162988/) (use WASD)
- [A somewhat addictive game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/315981172/fullscreen/) (with music I was probably not allowed to use)

Reeeeally old stuff I did in Scratch:
- [Colorful something](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/228527996/)
- [Prime numbers something](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/149259344/fullscreen/)
- [Zombie apocalypse but you are on the side of the zombies](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/157230875/)
- [My "biggest" "game"](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/224536034/) (You have to build cities and do quantum computing and like hunt ghosts at some point (???))
